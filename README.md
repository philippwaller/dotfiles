# 💻 Dotfiles Repository
Welcome to my dotfiles repository! This is a collection of my personal configuration files (dotfiles) primarily focused on enhancing the macOS experience. While the main focus is on macOS, some configurations may be applicable or adaptable to other UNIX-like systems.

## 📋 Overview
This repository is tailored for macOS users but also accommodates other environments where possible. It includes configurations for:

- Shell environment (Bash/Zsh) optimized for macOS but adaptable to other UNIX-like systems
- Git configuration
- Editor settings (e.g., Vim, VSCode)
- macOS system preferences and tweaks
- Cross-platform command-line tools and utilities
